      <h2><u>Para 2</u></h2>

        In the most general of terms, music is the arrangement of sound to
        create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise
        expressive content.<sup

        Definitions of music vary depending on culture,[4] though it is an
        aspect of all human societies and a cultural universal.[5] While
        scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there
        is no consensus on their precise definitions.[6] The creation of music
        is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and
        musical performance,[7] though the topic itself extends into academic
        disciplines, criticism, philosophy, psychology, and therapeutic
        contexts. Music may be performed using a vast range of instruments,
        including the human voice to sing, and thus is often credited for its
        extreme versatility and opportunity for creativity.

      <h2><u>Para 3</u></h2>
      <p>
        In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some
        extent improvised. For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the
        performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined
        structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz, the performers
        may take turns leading and responding while sharing a changing set of
        notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever,
        with each performer acting at their discretion. Music may be
        deliberately composed to be unperformable or agglomerated electronically
        from many performances. Music is played in public and private areas,
        highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra
        performances, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to
        a film, TV show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary
        function of an MP3 player or CD player, and a universal feature of
        radios and smartphones.
